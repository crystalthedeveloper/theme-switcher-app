# 🌓 Theme Switcher App for Webflow

A simple OAuth-powered Webflow app that helps users toggle between dark and light themes on their site — with a clean UI and a one-click script copy.

> ⚠️ Webflow does **not currently support automatic script injection** into Site or Page Settings via the API. Users must **manually paste** the script into **Site Settings → Custom Code**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Secure OAuth flow with Webflow
- 🧩 Webflow Designer Extension with install buttons
- 🎨 One-click script copy for easy manual paste
- 🧼 Clean, accessible UI built in Next.js
- 📱 Mobile-friendly and responsive layout
- ✅ Session-based install status detection
- 🧪 Developer test mode with console logs

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User clicks **Connect to Webflow**
2. OAuth exchange returns `access_token` + `site_id`
3. App shows status and copyable script
4. User pastes script into Webflow **Footer Code**
5. Done — theme switcher works on all published pages

---

## 🧩 Script to Add

Paste this in **Webflow → Site Settings → Custom Code → Footer Code**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/crystalthedeveloper/theme-switcher/theme-switcher.js" defer></script>
```

## 📁 Pages Overview

| `/callback` | Handles Webflow OAuth and token exchange |
| `/installed` | (Optional) Post-auth confirmation and re-injection |
| `/public/extension.js` | Webflow Designer Extension UI |
| `/api/inject` | Calls Webflow's PATCH `/custom-code` endpoint |
